## The map
The game is made with SDL, a graphics library in C. 
The map is made with a combination of rules and randomness.

## A bit of gameplay
You have an inventory, and every piece of material that you mine gets in there. With the good combination of wood you can make a pickaxe and hence mine rocks !
